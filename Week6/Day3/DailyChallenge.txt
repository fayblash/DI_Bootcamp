Create 3 different tables, each one with a different relationship.
Join them with all the types of PostgreSQL Joins youâ€™ve learned.

create table book(
id serial primary key,
title varchar(100),
author_f varchar (50),
author_l varchar(100),
genre varchar (50)

create table borrower(
id serial primary key,
first_name varchar(50),
last_name varchar (100),
email varchar(50)
)

create table loan(
id serial primary key,
book_id smallint not null,
borr_id smallint not null,
date_taken date,
loan_period smallint,
returned boolean,
foreign key (book_id) references book(id),
foreign key (borr_id) references borrower(id)
