Exercise 1 : DVD Rentals
Instructions
Get a list of all rentals which are out (have not been returned). How do we identify these films in the database?

select title from film
inner join inventory on inventory.film_id=film.film_id
inner join rental on rental.inventory_id=inventory.inventory_id
where rental.return_date is null

Get a list of all customers who have not returned their rentals. Make sure to group your results.

select first_name,last_name,count(*) as "number of outstanding rentals" from customer 
inner join rental on rental.customer_id=customer.customer_id
where rental.return_date is null
group by first_name,last_name

Get a list of all the Action films with Joe Swank.
Before you start, could there be a shortcut to getting this information? Maybe a view?

select title from film
inner join film_category on film.film_id=film_category.film_id
inner join category on category.category_id=film_category.category_id
inner join film_actor on film_actor.film_id=film.film_id
inner join actor on actor.actor_id=film_actor.actor_id
where category.name='Action' and actor.first_name='Joe' and actor.last_name='Swank'

Exercise 2 – Happy Halloween
Instructions
There is a zombie plague approaching! The DVD rental company is offering to lend all of its DVDs to the local shelters, so that the citizens can watch the movies together in the shelters until the zombies are destroyed by the armed forces. Prepare tables with the following data:

How many stores there are, and in which city and country they are located.

select city.city,country.country from store
inner join address on address.address_id=store.address_id
inner join city on city.city_id=address.city_id
inner join country on country.country_id=city.country_id

How many hours of viewing time there are in total in each store – in other words, the sum of the length of every inventory item in each store.


Make sure to exclude any inventory items which are not yet returned. (Yes, even in the time of zombies there are people who do not return their DVDs)

A list of all customers in the cities where the stores are located.

select customer.first_name,customer.last_name from customer
inner join address on address.address_id=customer.address_id
where address.city_id=300 or address.city_id=576

A list of all customers in the countries where the stores are located.

select customer.first_name,customer.last_name,country.country from customer
inner join address on address.address_id=customer.address_id
inner join city on city.city_id=address.city_id
inner join country on country.country_id=city.country_id
where city.country_id=8 or city.country_id=20

Some people will be frightened by watching scary movies while zombies walk the streets. Create a ‘safe list’ of all movies which do not include the ‘Horror’ category, or contain the words ‘beast’, ‘monster’, ‘ghost’, ‘dead’, ‘zombie’, or ‘undead’ in their titles or descriptions… Get the sum of their viewing time (length).
Hint : use the CHECK contraint

For both the ‘general’ and the ‘safe’ lists above, also calculate the time in hours and days (not just minutes).
