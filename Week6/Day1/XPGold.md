<!-- Exercise 1 : Bootcamp
Instructions
For this exercise, you will have to find some requests on your own!



Create
Create a database called bootcamp.
Create a table called students.
<!--  -->
CREATE TABLE students(
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 last_name VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
 first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
 birth_date DATE NOT NULL
)
<!-- Add the following columns:
id
last_name
first_name
birth_date.
The id must be auto_incremented.
Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?) -->


<!-- Here is the data:

first_name	last_name	birth_date D/M/Y
Marc	Benichou	02/11/1998
Yoan	Cohen	03/12/2010
Lea	Benichou	27/07/1987
Amelia	Dux	07/04/1996
David	Grez	14/06/2003
Omer	Simpson	03/10/1980 -->
INSERT INTO students (last_name, first_name,birth_date)
VALUES
('Benichou','Marc','1998-11-02'),
('Cohen','Yoan','2010-12-03'),
('Benichou','Lea','1987-07-27'),
('Dux','Amelia','1996-04-07'),
('Grez','David','2003-06-14'),
('Simpson','Omer','1980-10-03');


<!-- Insert
Insert the data seen above to the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.
Insert your last_name, first_name and birth_date to the students table (Take a look at the id given). -->


<!-- Select
Fetch all of the data from the table. -->
SELECT * FROM students
<!-- Fetch all of the students first_names and last_names. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students
<!-- For the following questions, only fetch the first_names and last_names of the students. -->
<!-- Fetch the student which id is equal to 2. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE id=2

<!-- Fetch the student whose last_name is Benichou AND first_name is Marc. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE last_name='Benichou' AND first_name='Marc'

<!-- Fetch the students whose last_name is Benichou OR first_name is Marc. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE last_name='Benichou' OR first_name='Marc'
<!-- Fetch the students whose first_name contains the letter a. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE '%a%'

<!-- Fetch the students whose first_name starts with the letter a. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%'

<!-- Fetch the students whose first_name ends with the letter a. -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE '%a'

<!-- Fetch the students whose second to last letter of their first_names is a (Example: Leah). -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE '%a_'

<!-- Fetch the students whose idâ€™s are equal to 1 AND 3 . -->
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE id=1 or id=3

<!-- Fetch the students whose birth_dates are equal to or come after 1/01/2000. (show all their info). --> -->
SELECT * FROM students WHERE birth_date >= '2000-01-01'
