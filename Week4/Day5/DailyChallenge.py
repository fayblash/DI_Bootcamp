# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Use List Comprehension
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world

# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world
# list_a=input("Enter a list of words separated by a comma (no spaces): ")
# list_a=list_a.split(",")

# list_b=[word for word in sorted(list_a)]
# print(list_a)
# print(list_b)
# print(*list_b, sep = ", ")
